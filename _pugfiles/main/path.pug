        |Working in the Revenue Management Innovation Lab my main task is to analyse business requirements and translate them to technical implementations realised either by vendors or by myself. These requirements can originate from group-wide projects, or the automation needs of the Revenue Management office. Ranging from developing price discrepancy tools to robots which manipulate the global distribution systems.
