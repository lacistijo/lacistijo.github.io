      <span>So, I decided to join the art challenge "Inktober" this year.
Ink is one of the many mediums I absolutely have no experience with. But as of tomorrow I'll draw something every day with my Sakura and Rotring fineliners (and I might use my brushpens for colours). This is my cover page for the challenge - I don't like it at all, but let's hope that at the end of the month I'll be able to re-create it for the better ðŸ˜Š
